Rails Dump
==========

Rails dump is an attempt to reproduce a very useful feature that exists in coldfusion, the CFDUMP tag is capable of dumping any object, string, array, structs, etc in a readable way.

TODO
==========

* Improve the object dump, for now it is only dumping the class name, it has to display methods and properties/values
* Improve the CSS, it some times breaks when mixed with the layout css
